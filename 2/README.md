Coding interview with an AdTech startup. Disclosure of the interview question is not allowed, so this is just a file of a brief training code on the similar type of question. One of the questions asked to convert the dataframe with one factor column and another summary statistics column right next to it into a single list of texts (ex - *US: 25*).
  
\* .csv file necessary for executing the practice code is included in this file (*daily_profit*).
