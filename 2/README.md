Coding interview with an AdTech startup. Disclosure of the interview question is not allowed, so this is just a brief training code on the similar type of question. One of the questions asked to convert the dataframe with one factor column and another summary statistics column right next to it into a single list of texts (ex - *US: 25*).
  
\* The .csv files given by the startup for solving questions could not be uploaded on my GitHub repository due to their sizes. Hence, I converted and uploaded them in .RData files (*ORD*, *COUPON*, *REC*, *RANK*).
